# Streamlit_Hackathon
This is a functioning connection that I designed for Streamlit's Connection Hackathon. It uses st.experimental_connections extending to  ExperimentalBaseConnection. My streamlit webpage connects to a Musixmatch API and generates the top-five songs based on the country code you enter. The top-5 songs may or may not be updated depending on Musixmatch
